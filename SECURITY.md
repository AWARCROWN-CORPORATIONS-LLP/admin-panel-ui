## 🔐 Common Security Considerations

Interns and contributors are expected to:
- **Avoid hardcoding credentials** (API keys, passwords).
- Use **input validation and sanitization** on all forms.
- Avoid usage of **eval(), innerHTML**, or any unsafe DOM injections.
- Log errors securely and avoid exposing stack traces.
- Keep third-party libraries (like Chart.js) up to date.
- Implement **role-based access control** in UI logic.

## 🧪 Security Practices in This Project

- Client-side role-based dashboard redirection.
- Input validation and controlled DOM manipulation.
- Secure usage of third-party libraries (CDN or local fallback).
- Encouraged modular JavaScript to reduce surface area.
